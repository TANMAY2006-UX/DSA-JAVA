### ⭐ About This Repository

This repository is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and growth as a software engineer. It serves as my personal code diary, where I document my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. My primary focus is to build a robust foundation in problem-solving by consistently and thoughtfully tackling DSA challenges.

I believe that true mastery comes from daily practice, not just theoretical knowledge. This is more than just a code dump; it is a live reflection of my dedication and a resource for me to review and strengthen my understanding of core computer science concepts.

### 🎯 My Goal: Consistency is Key

My mission is clear: to solve at least **two DSA problems every single day**. By maintaining this discipline, I aim to not only sharpen my coding skills but also to develop a methodical approach to breaking down complex problems and writing efficient, clean solutions.

### 📚 Repository Content

This repository is meticulously organized to reflect my learning path. I am actively working on adding new topics as I progress.

-   📁 **Arrays**: Solutions for a variety of array-based problems.
-   📁 **Searching**: Implementations of various search algorithms.
-   📁 **Practice**: A general collection of problems and concepts.

_This list will be updated as I explore new topics and create more folders._
